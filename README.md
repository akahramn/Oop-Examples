# Oop-Principles

1.Encapsulation

+ We can make a class read-only or write-only: for a read-only class, we should provide only a getter method. For a write-only class, we should provide only a setter method.
+ Control over the data: we can control the data by providing logic to setter methods, just like we restricted the stock keeper from assigning negative values in the above example.
+ Data hiding: other classes canâ€™t access private members of a class directly.

2.Inheritance
+ Code reuse: the child class inherits all instance members of the parent class.
+ You have more flexibility to change code: changing code in place is enough.
+ You can use polymorphism: method overriding requires IS-A relationship.

3.Abstraction
+ In Java, we can achieve abstraction in two ways: abstract class (0 to 100%) and interface (100%).
