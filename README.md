# Oop-Principles
1. Encapsulation
+ We can make a class read-only or write-only: for a read-only class, we should provide only a getter method. For a write-only class, we should provide only a setter method.
+ Control over the data: we can control the data by providing logic to setter methods, just like we restricted the stock keeper from assigning negative values in the above example.
+ Data hiding: other classes can’t access private members of a class directly.
